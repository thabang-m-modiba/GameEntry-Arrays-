# Using Arrays
* An array is a sequential collection of elements sharing a common type.
## Storing an Array.
* In Java, storing Objects in an array is like manaing a row of boxes, where each box doesn't holf the Object itself, but rather a "remote control" (reference) to these Objects.
* When you create an array of Objects, the array stores references to those Objects.

# Mini Project: GameEntry High Score
* In this mini project I use arrays to store Objects (Gamers)
* In this mini project i create a system that keeps track of top ten high scores of gamers.
* When a new high score is achieved, I check if it falls under the top ten scores and if it does, I insert this new high score in the appropriate location in the top 10.
